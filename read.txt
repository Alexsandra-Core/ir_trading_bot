Hello, Sam.
For a month, I did not have a chance to work on your project, because of the personal problems.
Sorry for the delayed result.
I start the work again in this project.

A few days ago, my freelancer account was restricted without any reason, so I can not work in freelancer platform anymore, and withdraw any funds and milestone.
So, I am going to contact you outside freelancer platform.

My Skype address: live:.cid.c9175fb6c6828be

Looking forward to receiving a message from you there.
Thank you.
